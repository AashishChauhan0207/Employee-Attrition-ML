# Employee-Attrition-ML

Machine learning model for predicting employee attrition based on HR analytics. Project completed during Algonive Internship.

## Overview

This project implements various machine learning algorithms to predict employee attrition using HR data. The model helps organizations identify potential turnover risks and understand key factors contributing to employee attrition.

## Features

- `Task_1_Employee_Attrition_Model.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook containing the model development and analysis
- `HR-Employee-Attrition.csv`: Dataset containing employee information
- `best_attrition_model.joblib`: Saved trained model
- `Employee_Attrition_Model.pdf`: Documentation and results analysis
- `Employee_Attrition_Model2.pdf`: Additional documentation

## Requirements

To run this project, you need Python 3.8+ and the following packages. You can install them using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the required packages
3. Open the Jupyter notebook `Task_1_Employee_Attrition_Model.ipynb`
4. Run the cells sequentially to:
   - Load and preprocess the data
   - Train the model
   - Evaluate the results
   - Make predictions

## Model Performance

The model's performance metrics and detailed analysis can be found in the notebook and accompanying PDF documentation.
